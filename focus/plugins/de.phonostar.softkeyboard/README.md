PhoneGap-SoftKeyboard
=====================

Android SoftKeyboard Plugin for PhoneGap  

Usage
-----

- `SoftKeyboard.show()` to show the keyboard
- `SoftKeyboard.hide()` to hide it
- Keyboard visible callback: `SoftKeyboard.isShowing(function(){ console.log('success'); }, function(){ console.log('fail'); })`

BTW:
To have callback for hiding and showing the keyboard you can use:
"showkeyboard" / "hidekeyboard" events wich are not mentioned in the docs.
